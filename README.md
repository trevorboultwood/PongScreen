# PongScreen
Large addressable LED screen with SD and IRremote support.

As inspired by BitLuni on youtube who build a matrix out of ping pong balls this arduino project takes this concept a little further and loads captures taken from glediator. 

Glediator is used to generate the captures and after congfiguring glediator with your size and LED order the output should be set to 'file'. Create your capures and name them '1.bin', '2.bin' and so on. The arduino will play these files and if an IR sensor is configured you can adjust the brightness and framerate.

This uses various of opensource libraries and more information is best sourced from the actual makers of these.
